# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a WhatsApp message capture system that monitors messages from a single business WhatsApp account across multiple groups (250+ groups) and stores them in a MySQL database. The system provides a simple web interface to view captured messages organized by group.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to capture all messages from WhatsApp groups where my business account is a member, so that I can store and analyze group communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL continuously monitor all WhatsApp groups where the business account is a member
2. WHEN a new message is received in any monitored group THEN the system SHALL capture the message content, sender information, group ID, and timestamp
3. WHEN a message is sent by the business account itself THEN the system SHALL ignore it and not store it in the database
4. IF the system receives over 250 group messages simultaneously THEN it SHALL handle them without data loss or system crashes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want all captured messages stored in a MySQL database, so that I can maintain a persistent record of all group communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is captured THEN the system SHALL store it in MySQL with group_id, sender_name, message_text, and timestamp fields
2. WHEN storing a message THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and handle database connection errors gracefully
3. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and queue messages until connection is restored
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue monitoring without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a simple web interface to view captured messages, so that I can easily browse communications from different groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL display all captured messages organized by group
2. WHEN I select a specific group THEN the system SHALL show only messages from that group
3. WHEN viewing messages THEN the system SHALL display sender name, message content, and timestamp for each message
4. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the web interface SHALL update automatically to show the latest messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to automatically connect to WhatsApp Web, so that I don't need manual intervention for message monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize WhatsApp Web connection using the business account
2. WHEN first connecting THEN the system SHALL display a QR code for WhatsApp Web authentication
3. WHEN the WhatsApp session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. IF reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a new QR code for re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to run continuously without requiring security measures, so that I can focus on message monitoring without authentication overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL run without user authentication or authorization requirements
2. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN users SHALL be able to view messages without login credentials
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically begin monitoring without user intervention
4. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL resume message monitoring automatically
